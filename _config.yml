  Hi, I am student, front end developer, and designer, currently studying BIS Multimedia at the University of Pretoria.
  I love to draw and create things! Any type of things, such as coding a new software that does something fun, or simply just drawing to express my creativity.
  For those wondering, I am fluent in English and able to speak Cantonese :D

  This is where you can write a little more about yourself. You could title this section **Interests** and include some of your other interests.

  Or you could title it **Skills** and write a bit more about things that make you more desirable, like *leadership* or *teamwork*
